\section{Largest and smallest topologies}
\label{exercises:01-A}

\begin{exercise}
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
    \item
      The intersection of any collection of topologies for \(X\) is a topology
      for \(X\).
    \item
      The union of two topologies for \(X\) may not be a topology for \(X\)
      (unless \(X\) consists of at most two points).
    \item
      For any collection of topologies for \(X\) there is a unique largest
      topology which is smaller than each member of the collection, and a unique
      smallest topology which is larger than each member of the collection.
  \end{enumerate}
