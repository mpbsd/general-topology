\section{Largest and smallest topologies}
\label{exercises:01-A}

\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item
  \item
    The union of two topologies for \(X\) may not be a topology for \(X\)
    (unless \(X\) consists of at most two points).
  \item
    For any collection of topologies for \(X\) there is a unique largest
    topology which is smaller than each member of the collection, and a unique
    smallest topology which is larger than each member of the collection.
\end{enumerate}
